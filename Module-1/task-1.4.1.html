<h1>1.4 - 15/10/12</h1>

<p>Thursdays lesson was really interesting in that it got a little deeper into code and git. I really enjoyed it, but there were times I felt that I was alittle out of my depth. Alex is great at explaining things, but if I'm going to get to grips with this, then I need to practice. </p>

<h2>Hope you're feeling better Alex!</h2>
