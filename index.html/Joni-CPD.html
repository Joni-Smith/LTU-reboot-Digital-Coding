    <h1>Reflection 22-10-20</h1>

    <p>
        Thursday's session was tricky but I felt a sense of acheivement by the time we got to the end of the session. <br>

        I enjoyed the lession, but it remnided me that I am at the beginning of my learning and there's still a long way to go. <br>

        I took the 
        <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_quiz.asp" target= "_blank">quiz</a> and got 31/40.

    <p> The lession worked better in smaller groups. We learned more complex CSS stuff and some times I got confused about which bits to put in the html and which bits to put in the CSS stlyesheet. <br> 
    Having said that, i'm surprised by how much I do know. It all seems to be coming together. 

    We had the homework to check out html html entities on google. I read <a ref="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_entities.asp" target="_blank">entities</a> 

    I discovered how to make this copyright symbol &copy;

    <p>This session we learned a lot about CSS and HTML and putting it all together. The lessons are definitely more complex but when I think back to where we started I'm amazed by how much I know.  </p>

    <h1>Reflection 3/11/20</h1>
    <p>Struggled to complete the 2.4.4 task. I couldn't get the css to work properly with the task. e.g. the image wasnt reducing in size. Ended up redoing - in my own time and it worked fine.
        retook the W3 test and got 37/40.

        I Completed this offline as I was sick on thursday. Found it easy to follow but coulnt work out how to get task 6 to work the way i wanted it to - gives me the wrong figure. I'll wait for Luke's demo to work out where I went wrong.
